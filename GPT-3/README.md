## GPT-3

GPT-3 model is available via the Beta program of Open AI API. The example shown here is quick tutorial to get started with the text generation task.

* The actual code is a text generation task, but in case preferred, the code can be modified to respond to alternative NLP task.
* The response is actually only the rest of the text phrase, but it can modified to provide more information.* 
* The model uses "Davinci"-engine, which is the currently most powerful model, but the engine used can be updated to reduce the costs of each api call.
* The code requires update of the secret key, which is provided by the Open AI API
* The exact phrase to be queried can be updated - the phrase can vary length, too.
* The exact number of words to be generated is actually selected as 5, which may be modified
